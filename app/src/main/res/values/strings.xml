    <string name="help_overview">   \tThe most important thing to know about ENotes is that ENotes consists of Pages
        and Notes, where each Page holds a collection of Notes. ENotes also has a web application located at
        www.enotes.site. If you log into www.enotes.site with the same account you used in this application,
        you will see all your Notes and Pages online as well!</string>
    <string name="help_page_description">
            \tThe first screen you will see after logging in to ENotes is the Pages screen. Here you will see a list of
        all the Pages you have created. To open a page, simple click on its name. To create a page, click the plus
        button floating near the bottom right corner of the screen when on the screen
        labeled "Pages" at the top. This will automatically open up the page in the next screen. First, give the Page
        a name by clicking in the purple bar at the top and typing in a name. Then you can create Notes in this Page by
        clicking the plus symbol by the bottom right of the screen. You can return to the list of your Pages at any time
        by clicking the Back button. You can also delete a Page, or change the way the Notes are sorted by clicking the
        three dots at the top right of the screen and selecting the corresponding option.</string>
    <string name="help_note_description">
            \tTo open a Note, click on the icon with its title or the first few words of the Note. This will open a screen
        where you can edit the contents of the Note. To change the title of the Note, click in the top colored bar of
        the Note screen and start typing. To change the contents, click anywhere in the gray and begin typing. You can
        further customize your note by clicking the three little dots at the top right of the screen which will open a
        menu in which you can choose to change the Note's color, font, or font size. When you are done editing your Note,
        you can either click the Save button to save your changes, the Cancel button to exit and discard all changes, or
        the Delete button to delete the entire note. These buttons are found at the bottom of the Note screen.
